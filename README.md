## Summary
With an approach focused on punctuality, agility, and commitment, I stand out in the Front-End area, where I found my true passion. I am proud of the updates in HTML, the internship carried out, and the creation of the WIKI in PHP Shell Script at SEPEP. In addition, I advanced with professional courses at Alura, such as CSS, HTML, Docker, Git/GitHub, and through the Nano Courses at FIAP for Python. My study of OOP is through college. I also highlight my portfolio in Jekyll, a significant achievement. I am determined to explore opportunities in technology and programming to drive the company beyond expectations, always seeking new challenges and horizons.
